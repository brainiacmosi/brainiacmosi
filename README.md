#👋 Hi, I’m Mosi!
Data Scientist | Neuroscientist | AI Enthusiast

I leverage a unique background in Cognitive & Clinical Neuroscience and modern Data Science to solve complex problems at the intersection of biology, AI, and technology. My research experience in neuroimaging and electrophysiology has equipped me with a deep understanding of complex, high-dimensional data, which I now apply to building intelligent systems.

- I’m currently working on: Sharpening my skills in Deep Learning, Generative AI, and Agentic AI, and applying them to projects in healthcare and life sciences.

- I’m currently learning: Advanced LLM deployment, autonomous AI agents, and MLOps best practices through specialized courses from Google and DeepLearning.AI.

- I’m looking to collaborate on: Projects involving medical imaging analysis, bioinformatics, computational neuroscience, or any application of AI for social good.

- 💬 Ask me about: Python, Data Science, Neural Networks, Neuroimaging (fMRI, EEG), the bridge between biological and artificial intelligence, or the philosophy of consciousness!
- 📫 To be in touch, You can find me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/acmshabani
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've performed intricate brain surgeries on rat models for stroke research. Now I train neural networks – a different kind of brain surgery!
